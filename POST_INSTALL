Congratulations, Mercury was successfully installed in your app. Documentation
and other useful info can be found at: https://github.com/mediatainment/mercury

Here's a post install checklist:

# add to your gemfile
gem 'fog'
gem 'carrierwave-ftp', :require => 'carrierwave/storage/ftp/all'

* Add and ENV Variable IMAGE_STORAGE_ENGINE with "fog" or "file"

set them to empty if not used.
IMAGE_STORAGE_ENGINE=s3
S3_SECRET=your_secret
S3_REGION=eu-west-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
S3_KEY=s3_key
IMAGE_STORAGE_MODEL_ENGINE=fog,file,...
IMAGE_STORAGE_ENGINE=s3,ftp,...

IMAGE_STORAGE_ENGINE=ftp
FTP_FOLDER=                 "/"
FTP_HOST=                   "ftp.gusta-v.at"
FTP_PASSWORD=               "asdfasdf1"
FTP_URL=                    "http://assets-development.gusta-v.at"
FTP_USER=                   "466608-developer"
* add //= require mercury # to your application.js

* DONT FORGET TO MIGRATE THE TB

* Adjust your application.js & css files to not `require_tree .`

* Learn about, and change configurations in app/assets/javascripts/mercury.js.

* If installed, you can make changes to the provided layout and css files too.

# mediatainment branch is not supporting paperclip out of the box (only carrierwave)

* If you want image processing and uploading (using paperclip by default):

  rails g mercury:install:images (use --orm=mongoid for MongoDB)
  bundle
  rake db:migrate (if using ActiveRecord)

* For a basic example of authentication for Mercury, install the example:

  rails g mercury:install:authentication
